# Replicator (Duplicator)
If you have a certain template with placeholders, you can use the VBA script make multiple instances of the template

How to use the tool:
1.	Create the template (.xltx) for the well type that you want to duplicate. 
2.	The field names (typical) and the replacements (well specific) can be specified in any order in the Settings tab of the tool
3.	Click on Duplicate button
4.	The tool will replace all the fields with the well specific entries and save the output as separate excel file (.xlsx file - including changes in header and footer as well)
5.	Optionally, if the user wants, the same well specific document (Ex:nest loading) can be converted to PDF and saved in the same location.
